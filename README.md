# Supibot
Main repository for the multi-platform, novelty and utility chat bot Supibot.

## Usage
You can now (relatively) easily clone/fork Supibot and run a local instance! 

Follow [the guide](docs/setup.md) if you are interested, and contact me if you have any questions or notes.

## Platforms
Supibot can and is currently run on four distinct platforms:
- [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/)
- [Discord](https://discordapp.com/)
- [Cytube](https://cytu.be/)
- ~~Mixer~~ (until 2020-07-22)
- [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/)

## I want to use Supibot!
Pick your platform, and follow these steps: 

| Platform | Directions |
| :---: |:---|
| **Twitch channel**  | Fill out [this form](https://supinic.com/bot/request-bot/form). |
| **Discord server**  | The **admin** of said server PMs me on Discord (friend request is not required).  | 
| **Cytube room**     | Support for joining multiple rooms on Cytube is not currently implemented - but can be, requested.  |
| **Minecraft server**| The owner of given Vanilla/Forge-modded Minecraft server needs to contact me, as this process is not trivial. |

To contact me, see [Contact](https://supinic.com/contact) on my website.

## DankChat integration
The [DankChat](https://github.com/flex3r/DankChat) mobile application for Twitch chat uses Supibot's API in order to hint its commands in any channel Supibot is actively in!
It's a really good app to use on the go, and I endorse it.
