- Twitch
- Discord
- Cytube
- Mixer

Some of the features include:
- setting an AFK status, and specifying a message when coming back
- reminders from user to user, timed reminders to others or yourself
- random lines in the scope of current channel
- various API commands, such as ones related to Twitch, or weather for a location, or time, and many more...
- many more commands, some of which use a local database

Each command will have its definition available on the website, soonâ„¢.
